# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: The difference between a parameter and an argument is a parameter is the name given that describe describes what you want the do. An argument is the actual values passed through the parameter.  

Researched answer: A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions. Argument is a value passed as input to a function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .Map takes the predefined parameters of the original array, also known as the callback function. It's callback function takes the inputs from the original array and outputs a new one, consisting of the return values in the same leangth array.  

Researched answer: 

3. What is the difference between map and filter? 

Your answer: The difference between map and filter is that map will return a new subset array in the same legth because of its callback features. Filter will return new subset array in unordered array that will contain only the values filtered for. Filters also compare your search parameters and responds with Boolean values (true, false). 

Researched answer: Map returns a subset array of pieces of information from the original array. In the callback function, return the data you wish to be part of the new array. a filter will return a subset of the original array in the same length, based on custom criteria.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: Performing a certain loop until it stopped or it reaches a predertermined set amount of loops.

Researched answer: There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: Methods and functions are about the same thing. only difference I know between them thus far is methods are associated with objects as functions aren't. Method is the behaviors assigned to an object 

Researched answer: 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: This definition beats me. I am having troubles understanding the definition as i read it directly. Please explain this in lame mens terms. 

Researched answer: JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

3. React state: built-in React object that houses info or data about a component

4. React props: Object where attributes of a tag is stored
